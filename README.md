In the realm of cancer, there exist over 200 distinct forms, with melanoma standing out as the most lethal type of skin cancer among them. The diagnostic protocol for melanoma typically initiates with clinical screening, followed by dermoscopic analysis and histopathological examination. Early detection of melanoma skin cancer is pivotal, as it significantly enhances the chances of successful treatment. The initial step in diagnosing melanoma skin cancer involves visually inspecting the affected area of the skin. Dermatologists capture dermatoscopic images of the skin lesions using high-speed cameras, which yield diagnostic accuracies ranging from 65% to 80% for melanoma without supplementary technical assistance. Through further visual assessment by oncologists and dermatoscopic image analysis, the overall predictive accuracy of melanoma diagnosis can be elevated to 75% to 84%. The objective of the project is to construct an automated classification system leveraging image processing techniques to classify skin cancer based on images of skin lesions.

The dataset consists of 2357 images of malignant and benign oncological diseases, which were formed from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC). All images were sorted according to the classification taken with ISIC, and all subsets were divided into the same number of images, with the exception of melanomas and moles, whose images are slightly dominant.


The data set contains the following diseases:

Actinic keratosis
Basal cell carcinoma
Dermatofibroma
Melanoma
Nevus
Pigmented benign keratosis
Seborrheic keratosis
Squamous cell carcinoma
Vascular lesion
